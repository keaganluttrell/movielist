PROMPT: Create a basic react application using the TMDB api.

Requirements:
- Display a list of movies
- Dispay a separate list for the movies a user has liked: (it should start empty)
- For each movie a user should be able to select a movie and add it to their list
- A User should also be able to remove movies from their list


Extra Challenges:
- Stye with Material UI
- Think of new ways to display the content
- Allow the user to rename their list
- Allow the user to have more than one list
- Display multiple lists for a user to choose from


[] - Install Dependencies

[] - Understand the File Structure

[] - Set up server to serve public files in public folder

[] - Create "Hello World" to make sure react and webpack are set up correctly

[] - Set up server to use API key generated from TMDB. Explain CORS

[] - Test api by making a simple front-end request to get movies and output to console in dev environment and also in browser dev tools

[] - save api output to file for testing and use this as mock data. you will need to import this at to top a file so that you can bypass api calls until your front-end is built

[] - Use React to create the front-end and meet requirements
